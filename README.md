# Fraudulent Credit Card Transaction Detection using CNN
1. Credit card companies must be able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
2. A Convolutional Neural Network is designed with Keras in Tensorflow 2 to predict whether the transaction made by the customer is fraudulent or not.
3. This was one of the Kaggle competition and the dataset was made available on Kaggle.
4. The highest testing accuracy achieved in this project is above 96%.


The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle.
